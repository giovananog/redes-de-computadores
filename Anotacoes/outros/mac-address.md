# MAC Address Overview

The MAC Address consists of a sequence of 6 bytes, where the first 3 bytes identify the manufacturer, and the last 3 bytes are a unique sequence generated by the manufacturer.

Example: `XX:XX:XX:YY:YY:YY`

- The manufacturer can be identified by researching in `oui.txt` or using websites that automate the process.

Despite having a unique factory-assigned address, the MAC Address can be easily changed. From a security standpoint, changing our true MAC Address can obscure identification via MAC address. This process, known as MAC spoofing, involves substituting our MAC address with one allowed on the network, thus bypassing MAC address-based controls.

On Linux, we can view our MAC address using the `ifconfig` command.

To change the MAC address on Linux, we can use `macchanger` (use `-r` for a new random MAC).

## Summary:

- **MAC Address Format:** XX:XX:XX:YY:YY:YY
- **Identification:** First 3 bytes (manufacturer), Last 3 bytes (unique sequence).
- **Discovering Manufacturer:** Use `oui.txt` or online tools.
- **Security Consideration:** MAC addresses can be changed for privacy (MAC spoofing).
- **Linux Command:** `ifconfig` to view, `macchanger -r` to change.

MAC addresses play a crucial role in network identification, and understanding how to manage them is essential for security and privacy considerations.

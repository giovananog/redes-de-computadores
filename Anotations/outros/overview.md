# Computer Networks: Overview

A computer network is a communication system involving two or more computers capable of exchanging information. Each computer in the network is referred to as a host, and we can have client and server hosts.

- **Server:** Provides services to the network.
- **Client:** Consumes services offered by a server.

Examples of servers include:
- **Web Server (www):** Provides web resources (sites, applications, etc.).
- **File Server:** Stores files from client hosts.

In our network scenario, let's consider a website. To achieve this, we need a web server. This web server host will provide the site to all hosts in the network, which are the client machines.

Given the diversity in hardware and software (e.g., Intel, AMD, Windows, Linux), protocols play a crucial role in ensuring communication between different computers. Protocols facilitate communication by handling physical and logical addresses and ports.

- **Physical Address (MAC Address):** Factory-defined.
- **Logical Address (IP Address):** Assigned based on network configuration.
- **Ports:** Used for communication.

In summary, protocols bridge the communication gap among diverse computers, ensuring seamless data exchange in a network.
